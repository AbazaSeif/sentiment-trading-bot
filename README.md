### Introduction
Whitebird is a trading bot that trades on the basis of the public sentiment of a coin. If the coin sentiment is negative, Whitebird opens a short position on it. If the sentiment for a coin is positive, Whitebird goes long.

Whitebird uses exchange APIs to open/close positions and uses the CryptoControl Sentiment API to get the sentiment for a particular coin based on crypto news sources.

For the purposes of this bot, CryptoControl has created a temporary API key that can be used for free until September 31st 2018
